      * added s3 driver
      * added s (skip) option

version 3.0
      * rewritten for performances (removed external log function support) - more than 10 times faster
      * removed dependency on bash_debug.sh watchdog and log function
      * added long opt support. Multiple options with one - is not supported anymore (ex. -co is not supported, shall be -c -o)
      * removed -b, -Z, -w option. Not used anymore.
      * -D option is deprecated. Debug can be now performed using standard bash debugging tools (sh -x)
      * timeout (-t option) is now expressed in seconds
      * secp now uncompress the files even if .gz or .tgz is written in the URI, since the new catalog
        contains URIs with the .gz and .tgz suffix, this is needed for retro compatibility of the services.
        This can be disabled with the new -U option. Moreover, for performance issues, secp will try adding only the
        .gz extension if the file do not exist, and not all the others.
      * added possibility to follow RDF and HTML auto-refresh meta-tag and HREF links for support to the new cache ws protocol
        and for direct download from the G-POD catalogue. This can be disabled using the new -H option.

      * retries (-r) and timeouts (-t) are now handled by the drivers (for performance issues)
      * added -rt option to setup delay between retries
      * removed WGET dependency, using curl insthead
